            <h3>In our last conversation i said im gonna end our friendship for some nonsense reasons.. You think im stupid and being annoying for saying that things.. But you don't know the exact reason behind it.. If you will know that reason may you'll end our friendship.. That's why i decided to do it first.. Cuz i only have you to chat otherwise my chat is empty.. I don't wanna lose my best friend for such things.. That's why i always says lets end this chat and chat negative... I'm not saying the reason here cuz this website is also not that good for privacy 🔏.. I'm 💯 sure you'll end our friendship by knowing the reason.. If you wanna know just say it , ill explain.. </h3>
